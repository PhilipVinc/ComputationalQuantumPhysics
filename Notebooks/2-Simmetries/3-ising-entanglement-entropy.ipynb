    " - Verify analitically (pen and paper) that the Hamiltonian has a $Z_2$ simmetry corresponding to the spin flip operator $$P=\\prod_i\\sigma^{x}_i$$. This operator has 2 eigenvalues. Find them. In the following I will call them $+$ and $-$.\n",
    "\n",
    " - As the Hamiltonian has this simmetry, it can be constructed in a simmetry subsector and diagonalised. Find whether the ground-state lies in the $+$ subsector or $-$ subsector by diagonalising the Hamiltonian in both and finding where the ground-state lies.\n",
    "    - to do it, look at the documentation of the ``quspin.basis.spin_basis_1d`` function in quspin.\n",
    "    - You will have to build both hamiltonians and diagonalise both.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For a reasonable system size $N$ (~16 is a good choice), for values of $h\\in[0,2]$ compute the following quantities:\n",
    "    - bipartite entanglement entropy S for all possible bi-partitions (``basis.quspin.ent_entropy``) where you separate the left and right half of the system. Bipartitions to be considered should be (in terms of sites) A={1} and B={2:L}, A={1,2}, B={3:L}, A={1,2,3},B=3,L ...\n",
    "        - Plot this curve of S(l) where l is the size of A. In the same plot, report the curve for different values of h. \n",
    "        - Before doing that, think about what you should see for $h~0$ and for $h>>1$. Is what you computed consistent with it? \n",
    "        - Identify the bipartition size $l$ for which $S(l)$ is maximum.\n",
    "        - In particular, reflect about what it means in terms of the complexity of the calculation. Do we really need 2^N complex numbers to represent the wavefunction?Where is the state the 'more complex'?\n",
