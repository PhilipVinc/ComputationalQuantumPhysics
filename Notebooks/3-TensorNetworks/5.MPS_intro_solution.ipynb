    "Today we will be investigating the basics of representing a wavefunction as a Matrix Product State (MPS). In particular you will have to:\n",
    "1. Convert a many-body wavefunction stored as a dense vector into an **MPS** using successive SVDs.\n",
    "2. Read off **Schmidt values** and compute the **bipartite entanglement entropy** across all cuts.\n",
    "3. Compute **expectation values** from the MPS and compare to ED.\n",
    "4. Explore **compression** by truncating the bond dimension $\\chi$ and quantify the encoding error .\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to the last 2 weeks, this time the lab exercise is somewhat more challenging, and there will be little physics but some more complex code. The algorithms you will have to implement where discussed this morning, and you will now have to convert them from _algebric formulas_ to code.  \n",
    "My suggestions for today:\n",
    "1. Think in small pieces. Do not write a huge function at once, instead try to split up your algorithms into smaller sub-blocks.\n",
    "2. Always double check the shape of tensors by `print(tensor.shape)` to make sure that they indeed have the shape you expect.\n",
    "3. When you're uncertain, think about how you can validate the result of your algorithm. For example, if you know your function `your_complex_function(...)` computes a matrix `A` in the middle which should be an isometry, you can check if `A` is indeed an isomtry. If it is, the problem is probably later. If it's not, the problem is before.\n",
    "4. Remember that the simplest way to write tensor contractions is `np.einsum`. It's not the fastest, but it's easy. Start simple, then if you feel brave you can look for a more efficient implementation.\n",

    "# 2. Convert an MPS to a dense vector\n",
    "\n",
    "You now how have to implement a function `mps_to_state` to revert the `mps` to a dense vector representation. This will allow us to test that the conversions are correct, as we will be able to check that `state == mps_to_state(state_to_mps(state))`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a function that contracts an open-boundary MPS back into a full state vector of length `d**L`.\n",
    "This is not efficient for big systems, but for `L<=12` it's fine and extremely useful for debugging and tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip:** Implementing this is relatively straightforward. Consider all MPS tensors to be 3-tensors, even the first and the last, and start contracting left-to-right with a vector of shape (1,) initialised to 1.0. At the end of the chains of contractions, you will get a 'matrix' of shape (1,1), which you should reshape into a scalar of shape (,) and it will be your result.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test to pass:** Without truncation, the reconstruction error must be tiny. So you should verify that if you go back the overlap between your original state and the one obtained by converting twice is 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To do:\n",
    "- Once your code is verified and works, do the following: consider the ground-state of the TFIM model computed with ED for $h=1$ at a fixed system size $N$. \n",
    "  - Convert those states with MPS, and impose a maximum bond dimension $\\chi$, and then back-convert them to a dense vector.\n",
    "  - The state now MIGHT be different. Compute the overlap which will be a number in $[0,1]$ and plot it as a function of the bond dimension cutoff $\\chi$. What do you learn?"

    "\n",
    "So far we've represented an MPS as a plain Python list of numpy arrays. This works, but as your code grows it becomes a bit error prone, as it's easy to forget the size or bond dimension of an MPS, and it's hard to remember how to operate on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard approach to solve those issues is to **wrap the MPS data in a class**, and defining a clean set of methods (aka, functions of the class) that operate on the data within the class\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps you:\n",
    "- **Group related data** that make up the MPS (tensors, bond dimensions, physical dimensions) into a single object, and always **move them together**. \n",
    "- **Define a clear interface**, because you can define methods like `MPS.expect(operator)` or `MPS.normalize()` or `MPS.entanglement_entropy()` which make the physics-part of the code much more readable and self-documenting. Moreover, if you pass it to someone else, it will be easier for them to understand , as they could just 'accept' that your .expect method works correctly and just look at other parts of it.\n",
    "- **Validate input data:** In the constructor of the class, which is the `__init__(self, ...)` method, you can validate that all tensors have the correct shape (eg, matching bond dimension, match physical hilbert space size...) so that you catch errors earlier.\n",
    "- **Easy to extend:** Want to add compression? Just add a `.compress(chi_max)` method instead of rewriting functions. And it will be easily discoverable just by pressing tab like `MPS.[\\tab\\tab\\tab]`.\n",
    "- **You can integrate with built in python functions:** By defining methods like `__add__` or `__matmul__` you can make your class work with `+` or `@` operators, which can be very nice. \n",
    "\n",
    "The tradeoff of encapsulating code in a class is that it takes some upfront design effort which is not always worth it. Usually, we prototype algorithms as 'free functions' and then when we know it works, we try to put it together in a class. \n",
