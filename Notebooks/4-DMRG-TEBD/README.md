# Lecture 4: Tensor Networks - DMRG & TEBD

This week contains **3 notebooks** on tensor network methods for 1D quantum systems.

## Main Notebooks

These notebooks focus on **using** tensor network methods to study physical phenomena.

- **6b. DMRG Ising Study** (`6b.DMRG_Ising_study.ipynb`)
  Use DMRG to find ground states of the Transverse Field Ising Model, identify the quantum phase transition at h=1, and extract critical exponents through finite-size scaling.

- **6c. TEBD XXZ Quench** (`6c.TEBD_XXZ_quench.ipynb`)
  Study quantum quench dynamics in the XXZ Heisenberg chain using TEBD, observing correlation spreading in light-cone structures and measuring entanglement growth after sudden parameter changes.

## Optional Notebook

- **6a. DMRG Implementation** (`6a.DMRG_implementation.ipynb`)
  For those interested in understanding the algorithm internals, there is an extra notebook about implementing DMRG 'from scratch' or 'by yourself'. This notebook is more technical and not mandatory, but I think you will learn a lot to try to do it. Nevertheless, regarding the course, it's more important you do the two above.
