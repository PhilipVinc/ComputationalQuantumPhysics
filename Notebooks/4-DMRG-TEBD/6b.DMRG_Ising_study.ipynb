    " - You should use 1-DMRG (or single-site dmrg, or just DMRG). Not 2-DMRG. You need to suffer a bit before you're granted the power of automatic powerful tools. For **tenpy** this means using SingleSiteDMRGEngine (https://tenpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/tenpy.algorithms.dmrg.SingleSiteDMRGEngine.html#tenpy.algorithms.dmrg.SingleSiteDMRGEngine) and you set the bond dimension in the initial state you feed it.\n",
    "   - The Engine above runs the full optimization until a convergence criterion is satisfied. To access the energy and other diagnostics at each sweep of DMRG, look at `engine.sweep_stats` attribute (https://tenpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/tenpy.algorithms.dmrg.DMRGEngine.html#tenpy.algorithms.dmrg.DMRGEngine.sweep_stats)\n",
    "   - You should try a few times to look at how the energy converges, and see if increasing $\\chi$ and $L$ affects convergence. Make a plot to prove that in the hardest point ($h=1$) you are converged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before computing observables, you should target an intermediate-size calculation (let's say $L=60$ ) and see how different choices of bond dimension $\\chi$ affect the accuracy of the energy. Decide on a plot to show that your choice of $\\chi$ is large enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute the following things:\n",
    " - Bipartite entanglement entropy $S_A(L)$ for the maximum bipartition as a function of system size $L$. Do this for $h=[0.5, 1.0, 1.5]$. \n",
    "    - You already did this in your assignment. But now you will be able to look at the curve up to very large $L$. You should identify the 'functional law' that governs the growth of the entanglement at those different points of $h$ by mans of fitting with some common funcitons ($\\sim L^\\alpha$ or $\\sim \\log(L)$ or $\\sim e^L$). Comment if you see an area law growth of the entanglement or if you see a violation.\n",
    " - Look at very large system sizes at the magnetization (squared) and numerical derivative of the magnetization (Squared).\n",
    " - (Optional) For the largest system size (~100? ~200?) try to make a fine grid in $h$ and plot the correlation length as sa function of $h-hcrit$ and try to extract the functional form linking the two."
