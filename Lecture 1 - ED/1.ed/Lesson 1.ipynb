    "# Lecture 1 : Exact Diagonalisation\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this lecture is to get acquainted with the foundational tool of computational quantum mechanics: Exact Diagonalisation (ED). \n",
    "ED is a reliable algorithm that produces 'exact' results which can be trusted, at the cost of scaling exponentially.\n",
    "ED is often used as a starting point and benchmark for approximate, more powerful methods but asymptotically less expensive methods, to check that they indeed give meaningfull results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general idea is that ED relies on diagonalising the hamiltonian exactly using some well known diagonalisation routines like [Lanczos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanczos_algorithm), which are implemented in numpy as [`scipy.sparse.linalg.eighs`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh.html).\n",
    "As the computational complexity of diagonalising a $M\\times M$ matrix scales roughly with the cube of the matrix size $O(M^3)$, if the size of the hilbert space, and therefore of the matrix grows exponentially with the system size such that $M=2^N$, then the total computational cost is $O(2^{3M})$ so it's exponential.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, diagonalising the matrix is often not the most expensive part of the algorithm. In the notebook below you will see that the most expensive part is to _construct_ the sparse matrix encoding the Hamiltonian. \n",
    "In following notebooks we will therefore investigate on computational techniques to reduce the cost of writing the Hamiltonian.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General things to keep in mind\n",
    "\n",
    "When working in computational physics, especially when using Python, there are some rules to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keep your code simple. A very messy code can house many bugs, and is hard for anybody else to read. Keep small functions that relate to mathetmatical expressions that you can verify somehow by hand, and then compose them together. Do not write huge functions that do many different things\n",
    "- Benchmark, benchmark, benchmark: It's important to always know what part of your code is the bottleneck. Often check with `%timeit` or similar techniques what part of your algorithm is the most expensive, and be aware of it!\n",
    "- **Write vectorized code** : always prefer to use numpy functions like `np.exp(array)` to writing for loops or list comprehensions. Numpy is much faster than for loops! And the code will be easy to run on GPUs one day.\n",
    "- When testing your code, test it on small systems where the runtime is of the order of few seconds at most. Once you are sure it works, test it on the large systems we are interested in because of the physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also\n",
    "- Keep in mind that we are physicists, and we want to generate plots in the end. Always think about what quantities we want to plot and aim to compute them!\n",
    "- When a code takes more than 20 seconds to run, it's usually worth it to 'log' or 'save' many quantities such that you don't have to run it again when you want to plot more stuff. \n"

    "\n",

    "You should:\n",
    "  1. Write the Hamiltonian as a $2^N \\times 2^N$ sparse matrix.\n",
    "      - For this first version, you can first write a set of functions like `sigmax(N: int, i: int) -> scipy.sparse` that take a number of sites and the site index and return the  $2^N \\times 2^N$ sparse matrix for this operator.\n",
    "        - a suggestion: start by writing the $2\\times 2$ matrices $\\sigma^x$, $\\sigma^z$ and identity, then use `scipy.sparse.kron` to take the kronecker product of a list of those operators such that it gives the operators that you want.\n",
    "      - Then, write an analogous `sigmaz` function and combine them both into a `ising_hamiltonian(N: int, h:float) -> scipy.sparse` function to write the Hamiltonian.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. Compute the ground-state energy and wave-function of the hamiltonian by using `scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh`:\n",
    "      - Be careful when using `scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh`: there are two arguments that you must specify which are very important:\n",
    "        - `k`, the number of eigenvalues/vectors you are interested in. This is 6 by default, and you might see an error if your matrix is smaller than that size. In general, how many eigenvalues do we want? So what could be the value of `k`that makes sense to use?\n",
    "        - `which`, if you specify that you want only k eigenvalues/vectors, WHICH k should scipy return to you? The largest? the smallest? Be careful in the difference between _algebraic_ magnitude and (absolute) magnitude. We are interested in the former, not the latter!\n",
    "  \n",
    "  3. Pick a reasonable system size `N` and a sufficiently dense grid of values for the transverse field `h`. Set `J=1`.\n",
    "      - Make a plot of the ground-state energy `E_0` (which `eigsh` returns) as a function of `h`.\n",
    "      - For every value of `h` compute the average magnetization along the `z` axis and make a plot of $\\langle m_z\\rangle $ as a function of h. \n",
    "        - This might look a bit messy for low values of `h`. Do you know why? Think about possible degeneracies.\n",
    "      - Make the same plot as above, but this time for the squared magnetization $\\langle m_z^2\\rangle $. What do we learn from it? Is this consistent with the previous plot?\n",
    "  \n",
    "  4. Now repeat the same study as above, but this time on each of the 3 plots where the x axis is the transverse field `h` and the y axis is an observable (energy, magnetization and magnetization squared) report multiple curves, each for a different value of `L` from 4 to whatever largest size you can achieve.\n",
    "      - It's a good idea to make legible plots to not rely on the default color sequence of matplotlib, which is an insult to aestethics. Instead, pick a color map that is easier to read for example because bright colors are smaller systems and darker colors are larger systems (or vice-versa). Examples are `magma` or `viridis` colormap, among many others. \n",
    "\n",
    "  5. We now want to understand what is the largest system size we could reasonably do, therefore you must benchmark the computational runtime of the `ising_hamiltonian` function for increasing N.\n",
    "      - Make a plot of the runtime of constructing the Hamiltonian as a function of N. How is this increasing?\n",
    "      - Compare this cost to diagonalising the matrix with `scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh`, as a function of N. Which is dominant? What is the largest size you can reasonably simulate on your laptop with this code?\n",
